## Overview  
Crypto ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§® is a Web3 platform that enhances event engagement through POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol), geofencing, and interactive 3D assets. By integrating AI, AR, and blockchain technology, it offers a seamless and rewarding experience for attendees. With features like intent-based staking and cross-chain compatibility, Crypto ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§® transforms events into interactive, community-driven experiences.

## How It Works  

1. **Event Attendance**: Users attend events and collect POAPs linked to their attendance.  
2. **Geofencing**: POAPs are enhanced with geolocation data for authenticity.  
3. **Reward System**: Users redeem POAPs for loyalty tokens or exclusive event perks.  
4. **AI Interaction**: On-chain AI agents provide personalized recommendations and manage staking based on user intent.  
5. **Cross-Chain Transactions**: Leveraging Okto and other platforms, transactions are processed seamlessly across supported chains.

## Challenges We Faced  

1. **Learning Non-EVM Chains**  
   Understanding **Move** programming and adapting to the resource-focused models of **Aptos** and **Sui** was a steep learning curve.  
   
2. **Geofencing and 3D Assets**  
   Designing geofencing-based POAPs with interactive AR elements required precise alignment with real-world locations and user devices.  

3. **Multichain Transactions**  
   Implementing secure, multichain transactions with Okto's infrastructure required extensive testing and optimization.  

4. **On-Chain AI Integration**  
   Developing intent-based staking mechanisms with on-chain AI agents was a novel challenge that pushed the boundaries of smart contract logic.
